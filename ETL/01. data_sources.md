# Data Extraction Methodology

The data extraction process is structured into three distinct parts:

## Part I: Extraction of Antibiotics Sales Data in Brazil

### 1.0 - Initial Phase
In this initial phase, data pertaining to the sale of antibiotics in Brazil is extracted. This part comprises two key elements:

### 1.1 - Controlled Industrialized Medication Sales Records
We gather records of sales related to controlled industrialized medications from ANVISA (Agência Nacional de Vigilância Sanitária). These records are sourced from the official government data repository available at [link 1.1](https://dados.gov.br/dados/conjuntos-dados/venda-de-medicamentos-controlados-e-antimicrobianos---medicamentos-industrializados).

### 1.2 - Manipulated Controlled Medication Sales Records
Additionally, we extract data concerning the sale of manipulated controlled medications from ANVISA's records. The source for this dataset is the official government data repository, accessible via [link 1.2](https://dados.gov.br/dados/conjuntos-dados/venda-de-medicamentos-controlados-e-antimicrobianos---medicamentos-manipulados).

## Part II: Extraction of Obituary Data in Brazil

### 2.1 - Acquisition of Obituary Data
The second part of our data extraction process is centered around the acquisition of obituary data in Brazil. We accomplish this by obtaining records of all deaths from the SIM (Sistema de Informações sobre Mortalidade) database, which can be accessed at [link 2.1](https://dados.gov.br/dados/conjuntos-dados/sim-1979-2019).

## Part III: Extraction of Population Density Data

The final segment of our data extraction involves the retrieval of data related to population density. We obtain two sets of data:

### 3.1 - Population Estimates for Brazilian Cities
Population estimates for cities in Brazil are procured from the Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística (IBGE). The dataset is available at [link 3.1](https://www.ibge.gov.br/estatisticas/sociais/populacao/9103-estimativas-de-populacao.html).

### 3.2 - Geographical Dimensions of Brazilian Cities
Geographical dimensions and sizes of Brazilian cities are sourced from the IBGE dataset, accessible via [link 3.2](https://www.ibge.gov.br/geociencias/organizacao-do-territorio/estrutura-territorial/15761-areas-dos-municipios.html).

## Summary

The data extraction process ensures a comprehensive approach to gathering crucial datasets from reliable sources. Each part focuses on a specific type of data, essential for thorough analysis and informed decision-making.
