# 1- Project Motivation:
In the modern, interconnected world we live in, the state of public health in any country has far-reaching implications beyond its borders. Brazil, as one of the largest and most populous countries in the world, plays a significant role in shaping global health outcomes. However, the nation faces numerous challenges in maintaining proper and effective sanitary control mechanisms, which can be a threat not only to its own citizens but also to the wider international community.

Brazil's healthcare system has made substantial progress over the years, but it still grapples with disparities in access to quality healthcare services. The country's vast geographical size and diverse population present unique challenges in providing universal healthcare coverage. This inequality in healthcare access not only affects the health and well-being of Brazilians but also has broader implications for global health security.

## 1.1 In the face of 21st-century challenges,  
Brazil is confronted with a critical task: strengthening the preparedness of its medical institutions and its supply chains. The imperative to understand historical pandemics, forecast recurring trends, and decipher medical patterns is pivotal for efficient and proactive medical interventions within the country. Notably, the emergence of drug-resistant bacteria in Brazil, fueled by inadequate oversight and excessive antibiotic usage, could pose a potential threat not only to the nation but also to the broader global community in the immediate future.

## 1.2 When antibiotics are not used properly,
they may not fully eradicate the bacteria, allowing the surviving bacteria to develop and spread resistance.
In conclusion, the professional approach to combating antibiotic resistance encompasses a range of strategies, from prudent antibiotic use and new drug development to infection control and global collaboration. This concerted effort is essential to slow the emergence and spread of antibiotic-resistant strains, safeguard public health, and ensure the continued efficacy of these critical life-saving medications.

#  2- Bacteria can develop resistance to antibiotics and other antimicrobial agents : 
This process is known as antibiotic resistance, and it poses a significant challenge to modern medicine.
Here are some of the key ways in which bacteria develop resistance:  
### 2.1 Mutation: 

Bacteria reproduce rapidly, and occasionally, random mutations occur in their DNA during replication;  
### 2.2 Horizontal Gene Transfer: 
Bacteria can share genetic material with each other through processes like conjugation, transformation, and transduction;  
### 2.3 Selection Pressure: 
The use and overuse of antibiotics create a strong selective pressure on bacteria. When antibiotics are used to treat infections, they kill susceptible bacteria but may leave behind those with resistance. Over time, the surviving resistant bacteria can multiply, leading to a population of bacteria that is predominantly resistant to the antibiotic;  
### 2.4 Antibiotic Misuse: 
Inappropriate use of antibiotics, such as not completing a full course of antibiotics as prescribed by a healthcare provider or using antibiotics for non-bacterial infections, can contribute to the development of resistance.

# 3- Metodology:



Data Compilation and Preparation: 


To embark on this mission, 93 CSV files have been meticulously sourced from the Brazilian governmental open data repository, accessible at "https://dados.gov.br/home". This files represented These raw datasets have been channeled into a local Microsoft SQL server through the strategic utilization of SQL's Bulk Copy Program (BCP). This initial phase serves to cleanse and streamline the data, priming it for subsequent analytical endeavors.

Objectives: Explore and uncover patterns, glean insights, and forge connections within this wealth of data. Aiming to contribute to the fortification of medical strategies in a world where preparedness and awareness is paramount. And maybe answer some questions like: 

### A - How the sales notifications raised in a time-frame perspective?

### B - Where were the potential Hot Zones in Brazil?

### C - What is the 

### D - Sales Ratios are increasing?

### E - Antibiotics efficiency is decreasing?

### F - Population density plays any role into this matter?

# 5- Python and Pandas Integration:

Given the substantial size of these files, a strategic fusion of Python and the Pandas framework has been deployed to execute specific tasks. Python scripts have been harnessed to undertake preliminary operations such as pruning redundant columns prior to data importation into the database. This strategic employment of Python ensures not only data integrity but also enhances the overall project's legibility and manageability.

Throughout this journey, I play the dual role of data miner and curator. Together, we delve into the labyrinthine records of Anvisa (Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency), and SIM (Mortality Information Systems), that is a of SUS focusing on the sales data of target antibiotics medications. An intriguing focus of this endeavor involves dissecting the antibiotic landscape, particularly those employed to combat drug-resistant bacteria within Brazil.
