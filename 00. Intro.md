## 1- Project Motivation:

In the face of 21st-century challenges, a critical task lies in fortifying preparedness of medical institutions and their supply chains. The imperative to comprehend historical pandemics, forecast recurring trends, and decipher medical patterns stands as pivotal for efficient and proactive medical interventions. Notably, the emergence of drug-resistant bacteria, fueled by inadequate oversight and excessive usage, looms as a potential global threat in the immediate future.

## 2- Scientific Context: 
Bacteria can develop resistance to antibiotics and other antimicrobial agents through various mechanisms. This process is known as antibiotic resistance, and it poses a significant challenge to modern medicine.
Here are some of the key ways in which bacteria develop resistance:  
### 2.1 Mutation: 
Bacteria reproduce rapidly, and occasionally, random mutations occur in their DNA during replication;  
### 2.2 Horizontal Gene Transfer: 
Bacteria can share genetic material with each other through processes like conjugation, transformation, and transduction;  
### 2.3 Selection Pressure: 
The use and overuse of antibiotics create a strong selective pressure on bacteria. When antibiotics are used to treat infections, they kill susceptible bacteria but may leave behind those with resistance. Over time, the surviving resistant bacteria can multiply, leading to a population of bacteria that is predominantly resistant to the antibiotic;

## 2- Metodology:



Data Compilation and Preparation: 


To embark on this mission, 93 CSV files have been meticulously sourced from the Brazilian governmental open data repository, accessible at "https://dados.gov.br/home". These raw datasets have been channeled into a local Microsoft SQL server through the strategic utilization of SQL's Bulk Copy Program (BCP). This initial phase serves to cleanse and streamline the data, priming it for subsequent analytical endeavors.

## 3- 
Objectives: Explore and uncover patterns, glean insights, and forge connections within this wealth of data. Aiming to contribute to the fortification of medical strategies in a world where preparedness and awareness is paramount. And maybe answer some questions like: 

### A - How the sales notifications raised in a time-frame perspective?

### B - Where were the potential Hot Zones in Brazil?

### C - Population density plays a major role into this matter? 

### D - Sales Ratios are increasing?

### E - Antibiotics efficiency is decreasing?

### F - Population density plays a major role into this matter?

## 4- Integrating Python and Pandas:

Given the substantial size of these files, a strategic fusion of Python and the Pandas framework has been deployed to execute specific tasks. Python scripts have been harnessed to undertake preliminary operations such as pruning redundant columns prior to data importation into the database. This strategic employment of Python ensures not only data integrity but also enhances the overall project's legibility and manageability.

Throughout this journey, I play the dual role of data miner and curator. Together, we delve into the labyrinthine records of Anvisa (Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency), focusing on the sales data of target antibiotics medications. An intriguing focus of this endeavor involves dissecting the antibiotic landscape, particularly those employed to combat drug-resistant bacteria within Brazil.
