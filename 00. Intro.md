## 1. - Project Motivation:
In the modern, interconnected world we live in, the state of public health in any country has far-reaching implications beyond its borders. Brazil, as one of the largest and most populous countries in the world, plays a significant role in shaping global health outcomes. However, the nation faces numerous challenges in maintaining proper and effective sanitary control mechanisms, which can be a threat not only to its own citizens but also to the wider international community.

Brazil's healthcare system has made substantial progress over the years, but it still grapples with disparities in access to quality healthcare services. The country's vast geographical size and diverse population present unique challenges in providing free universal healthcare coverage. This inequality in healthcare access not only affects the health and well-being of Brazilians but also has broader implications for global health security.

## 1.1 - In the face of 21st-century challenges,  
Brazil is confronted with a critical task: strengthening the preparedness of its medical institutions and its supply chains. The imperative to understand historical pandemics, forecast recurring trends, and decipher seasonal patterns is pivotal for efficient and proactive medical preventive care within the country. Notably, the emergence of drug-resistant bacteria in the globe, fueled by inadequate oversight and excessive antibiotic usage, could pose a potential threat not only to the nation but also to the broader global community in the immediate future.

## 1.2 - When antibiotics are not used properly,
they may not fully eradicate the bacteria, allowing the surviving bacteria to develop and spread resistance. Yeah that's right, that's what you heard. Spread resistent DNA to other bacterias. 
In conclusion, the professional approach to combating antibiotic resistance encompasses a range of strategies, from prudent antibiotic use and new drug development to infection control and global collaboration. This concerted effort is essential to slow the emergence and spread of antibiotic-resistant strains, safeguard public health, and ensure the continued efficacy of these critical life-saving medications.

##  2 - Bacteria can develop resistance to antibiotics and other antimicrobial agents : 
This process is known as antibiotic resistance, and it poses a significant challenge to modern medicine.

Here are some of the key ways in which bacteria develop resistance:  
### 2.1 - Mutation: 
Bacteria reproduce rapidly, and occasionally, random mutations occur in their DNA during replication;  
### 2.2 - Horizontal Gene Transfer: 
Bacteria can share genetic material with each other through processes like conjugation, transformation, and transduction;  
### 2.3 - Selection Pressure: 
The use and overuse of antibiotics create a strong selective pressure on bacteria. When antibiotics are used to treat infections, they kill susceptible bacteria but may leave behind those with resistance. Over time, the surviving resistant bacteria can multiply, leading to a population of bacteria that is predominantly resistant to the antibiotic;  
### 2.4 - Antibiotic Misuse: 
Inappropriate use of antibiotics, such as not completing a full course of antibiotics as prescribed by a healthcare provider or using antibiotics for non-bacterial infections, can contribute to the development of resistance.

## 3. - Metodology:



Data Compilation and Preparation: 


To embark on this mission, Anvisa and SIM files have been meticulously sourced from the Brazilian governmental open data repository, accessible at "https://dados.gov.br/home". These raw datasets have been channeled into a local Microsoft SQL server through the strategic utilization of SQL's Bulk Copy Program (BCP). This initial phase serves to cleanse and streamline the data, priming it for subsequent analytical endeavors.

## 4. - Objectives: Explore and uncover patterns, glean insights, and forge connections within this wealth of data.


Aiming to contribute to the fortification of medical strategies in a world where preparedness and awareness is paramount. And maybe answer some questions like: 

### A - Is the mortality rate due to infectious diseases arising in Brazil? At which ratios?

### B - The antibiotics sales are also arising? 

### C - How the targeted antibiotics sales, changed over time? (01/2014 ~ 11/2021 )

### D - There's correlation between death ratios and antibiotics sales ratios?   (01/2014 ~ 11/2021 )

### E - What is the profile of notifications of antibiotic sales in terms of specific types of antibiotics sold?

### F - Is there a trend of increasing sales rates of antibiotics used for resistant bacteria over time?

### G - Is there evidence that the effectiveness of antibiotics is decreasing based on sales notifications and the incidence of resistant bacteria     (needs improvment)

### H - Is there a correlation between population density in different geographic areas and notifications antibiotics sales related to resistant bacteria? (needs improvment)

## 5. - Python and Pandas Integration:

Given the substantial size of these files, a strategic fusion of Python and the Pandas framework has been deployed to execute specific tasks. Python scripts have been harnessed to undertake preliminary operations such as pruning redundant columns prior to data importation into the database. This strategic employment of Python ensures not only data integrity but also enhances the overall project's legibility and manageability.

Throughout this journey, I play the dual role of data miner and curator. Together, we delve into the labyrinthine records of Anvisa (Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency), and SIM (Mortality Information Systems), that is a of SUS focusing on the sales data of target antibiotics medications. An intriguing focus of this endeavor involves dissecting the antibiotic landscape, particularly those employed to combat drug-resistant bacteria within Brazil.

## 6. - Extra Context: 

### 6.1 - What is the ANVISA?

ANVISA stands for the "Agência Nacional de Vigilância Sanitária" in Portuguese, which translates to the "National Health Surveillance Agency" in English. ANVISA is the regulatory agency in Brazil responsible for overseeing and regulating various aspects of health and sanitary issues, including the approval and regulation of pharmaceuticals, medical devices, food safety, and other health-related matters.
### 6.2 - What is the SIM?   
"SIM" refers to the "Sistema de Informações sobre Mortalidade," which translates to "Mortality Information System" in English. It is a system used for collecting and analyzing data related to deaths and mortality rates in various contexts, such as public health and vital statistics.
### 6.3 - What is the IBGE?   
IBGE stands for the "Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística", which translates to the "Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics" in English. IBGE is the official statistical agency of Brazil responsible for collecting, analyzing, and disseminating various statistical data and information related to the country's demographics, geography, economics, and social aspects. Its primary mission is to provide accurate and reliable data that supports decision-making, research, and policy formulation in Brazil. IBGE conducts censuses, surveys, and other data collection activities to gather information about the Brazilian population and its territory.

### 6.4 Boundary set:   
If you're wondering, in mathematics, the terms 'boundary of a set' and 'bounding set' refer to a collection of elements that define or enclose the boundaries of other sets. You must be asking yourself: "What this has to do with the context?" Well, this is how we defined the temporal limit we're dealing in this analysis: the date range available in Anvisa files (from JAN 2014 to NOV 2021).
